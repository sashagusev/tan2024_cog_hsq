Interpreting column names as follows:
population_N:	Sample size
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
population_Z:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.
population_pval:	p-Value

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from ./eur_w_ld_chr//w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from tan_2024_cognitive_performance.gz into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 6027096 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 4890153 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 0 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1136943 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1136943 SNPs remain).
Removed 91236 SNPs with N < 9889.0 (1045707 SNPs remain).
Median value of SIGNED_SUMSTATS was -0.00279282959428, which seems sensible.
Removed 1 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1045706 SNPs remain).
